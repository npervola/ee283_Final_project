AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> /bio/npervola/ATACseq/scATAC/raw_data/original_basal_luminal/scATAC.Combined_R1_Sequences.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Nextera 	16249	CTGTCTCTTATA	250000			6.50%
Illumina	937	AGATCGGAAGAGC	250000			0.37%
